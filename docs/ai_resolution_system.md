# System Guardian Technical Architecture Document

## Overview

System Guardian is an AI-driven incident management platform designed to autonomously monitor, analyze, and provide solution recommendations for on-call incidents. This platform integrates with Slack, GitHub, Jira, Datadog, and other tools to provide real-time insights and AI-driven remediation suggestions.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Extraction and Processing Flow

System Guardian uses an event-driven microservices architecture to extract event data from multiple sources:

1. **Multi-source Data Extraction**
   - **GitHub Integration**: Monitor code commits, issues, and deployment events
   - **Jira Integration**: Track issues and comments
   - **Datadog Integration**: Handle system alerts and monitoring data
   - **Technical Documentation Integration**: Support uploading technical documentation to Qdrant vector database as a knowledge base reference for AI solution generation, improving the accuracy and reliability of AI solutions

2. **Uniform Message Specification**
   - Implement a uniform event model (Event model), converting data from different sources into standard format
   - Use JSONB data type to save complete original event content, ensuring context completeness
   - Implement cross-platform event classification through standardized source, event_type fields
   - Internal message conversion layer ensures consistent processing of external events

3. **Event Processing Flow**
   - Use RabbitMQ as a message queue to ensure event processing reliability
   - Event consumption service (EventConsumerService) is responsible for extracting and processing events from the queue
   - Standardize event data and store it in the PostgreSQL database

4. **Event Analysis and Response Mechanism**
   - System automatically analyzes event data to identify potential incidents
   - Once an incident is confirmed, it immediately sends a notification to the relevant team via Slack robot
   - At the same time, it automatically creates a Jira ticket to track resolution progress
   - Based on incident context and historical data, it generates preliminary resolution suggestion (Resolution) immediately
   - Track notification and response status throughout the process for subsequent optimization

5. **Data Standardization**
   - Convert data from different sources into a unified event and incident model
   - Establish the relationship between events and incidents to build a complete incident context

## Data Model

System Guardian uses SQLAlchemy ORM to define the following core models:

1. **Incident**
   - Represents system issues, including title, description, severity, and status
   - Establish associations with triggered events and related events

2. **Event**
   - Event data from various sources
   - Contains source, event type, and complete event content
   - Uniform event model ensures consistent processing of data from different sources

3. **Resolution**
   - AI-generated or manually provided event resolution
   - Contains suggestion text, confidence score, and user feedback

## Scalability and Reliability Design

1. **Scalable Service Architecture**
   - Microservices design allows independent expansion of each component
   - Connection pool configuration optimization ensures high concurrency processing capability

2. **Reliability Measures**
